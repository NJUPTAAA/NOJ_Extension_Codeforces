# NOJ_Extension_Codeforces
Codeforces interface for NOJ

# Configuration

Judge Agent should be a valid CodeForces account.

We highly recommend **5~10 Judge Agents** enabled for CodeForces NOJ Babel Extension.

Set username the handle and password the password from CodeForces.

**Setting email as handle will break some features like `babel:judge`.**
